## WEEK 5 - ANALOG INPUT

### EXAMPLE 1:

*The program prints out values from 0 to 1023 (according to the position of the potentiometer).*

### EXAMPLE 2:

*Write a program that continuously prints out the analog value of PC3 through the serial port. Assume the followings:*

*•The clock speed of the microcontroller is 16MHz*

*•The desired clock speed of ADC is 125 kHz.*

*•Use AVCC as analog reference.*

*•On-demand mode*

### EXAMPLE 3:

*Modify example 2 to put the ADC in continuously running mode (auto-trigger).*
