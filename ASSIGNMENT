 EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: EMBEDDED SYSTEM IN HEALTHCARE

PUSH FACTORS: 

1. Real-time monitoring and recording the patients' health status (H-IoT):

With the existnce of certain sensors, the condition of the patient from time to time.
The two type of primary sensors for the data health collection are motion and physiological sensors. This is due to 
many number of visit to the physician. Due to pandemic, the number of visit should be reduced

2. Early Risk Detection:

This ERD can help us to deal with many types of problems such as early depression detection (EDD).It is important to have EDD which can 
detect the depression accurately in order to ensure that the potential depressed paper receives the treatment as soon as possible. Many technologies are been introduced.
For instant, EEG (electroencephalogram) and ECG (electrocardiogram). Major depression can be detected by ECH based on the heart rate reading for 30 minutes, 
the longer the duration of the reading, more accurate the result.


3. Assist the doctor and nurse: 

Robot can help the doctors and nurse in the healthcare. Espcially during the pandemic where many doctors and nurses are needed. For example, the robot that deal with
healthcare delivery. Robots have the potential to provide assistance to healthcare providers in daily caregiving tasks. Transport, telemedicine, and service robots in 
healthcare promise to create a new level of quality healthcare by providing experts to patient.  robots such as surgical
robots, logistics robots, disinfectant robots, cleaning robots, pill robots, laboratory robots, rehabilitation robots, nursing
robots, telepresence robots, therapy robots, assistive robots, robotic prosthetic limbs, diagnostics robots, and many other types
