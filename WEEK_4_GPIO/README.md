## WEEK 4 - GPIO

### EXAMPLE 7:

*There are two LEDs whose anodes are connected to PB0 and PB1 respectively. The LED1 needs to be flashing with ON time 750 ms and OFF time 350ms.
The LED2 needs to be flashing with ON time 400ms and OFF time 600ms.*

### EXAMPLE 8:

*Five switches (A,B,C,D,and E) are connected to ATmega328p as shown below.The microcontroller needs to keep track of how many times each button has 
been pressed. Whenever any button has been pressed,the microcontroller needs to send out the information (of how many times each button has been pressed)
through the serial port. Program the microcontroller to accomplish this.*

### EXAMPLE 9:

*Write a program for ATmega328p that blinks 8 LEDs (on PD0 to PD7) with the following on and off times.*
